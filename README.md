# backseat-gAOEmer
- Started off as a simple Saracen "Market Abuse" on Ten Times Civ Bonus (ttcb) mode in AOE2DE using pyautogui and eventually became an idea for automated backseat-game like advisor. 

## saracenAbuse
- Simulates pressing keyboard keys using pyautogui, 
- Adds function which "abuses" the market x times,
- Later add it into the main loop
